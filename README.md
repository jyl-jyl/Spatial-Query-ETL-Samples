## This repo contains some spatial queries and ETL scripts I wrote in previous coursework. 

### All queries in this project are formulated using _PostgreSQL_ and _PostGIS_. 

These queries encompass a range of tasks, such as distance calculations, ordering, identifying optimal routes, and locating the best sites. Publicly available data on population, properties, transportation, land use, and other relevant datasets were utilized for these queries. Prior to executing the queries, the datasets were cleaned and loaded into a Postgres Server using org2ogr and Python.

### All ETL scripts were written in both _Python_ and _NodeJS_

These scripts will extract census data and property data, and load them onto Google Cloud Platform's storage.
