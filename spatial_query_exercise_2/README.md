## Write a query to answer each of the questions below.

_Answers for each question is listed as `query01.sql`, `query02.sql`, ..._



### Datasets

* Indego Bikeshare station status data
* Indego Trip data
  - Q3 2021
  - Q3 2022

All data is available from [Indego's Data site](https://www.rideindego.com/about/data/).

Load all three datasets into a PostgreSQL database schema named `indego` (the name of your database is not important). Your schema should have the following structure:

> This structure is important -- particularly the **table names** and the **lowercase field names**; if your queries are not built to work with this structure then _your assignment will fail the tests_.

* **Table**: `indego.trips_2021_q3`  
  **Fields**:
    * `trip_id TEXT`
    * `duration INTEGER`
    * `start_time TIMESTAMP`
    * `end_time TIMESTAMP`
    * `start_station TEXT`
    * `start_lat FLOAT`
    * `start_lon FLOAT`
    * `end_station TEXT`
    * `end_lat FLOAT`
    * `end_lon FLOAT`
    * `bike_id TEXT`
    * `plan_duration INTEGER`
    * `trip_route_category TEXT`
    * `passholder_type TEXT`
    * `bike_type TEXT`

* **Table**: `indego.trips_2022_q3`  
  **Fields**: (same as above)

* **Table**: `indego.station_statuses`  
  **Fields** (at a minimum -- there may be many more):
    * `id INTEGER`
    * `name TEXT` (or `CHARACTER VARYING`)
    * `geog GEOGRAPHY`
    * ...
